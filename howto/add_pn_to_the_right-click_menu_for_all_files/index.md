# PN Shell Extension

The shell extension works on all 32-bit versions of Windows, and adds Programmer's Notepad to the right-click (context) menu for all files. To install the shell extension:

  - Open a command prompt window and go to the Programmer's Notepad directory
  - Run "regsvr32 pnse.dll"

You should now be able to launch PN directly from the right-click menu.
